## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on javafx programming
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, C++, C#, Assembly, lua, and python
- ğŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my current projects
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: (I have not set up a business email yet)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: We're a team! (But if that's boring to you, I have coded a browser from scratch in javafx that I want people to be able to fork and use)
